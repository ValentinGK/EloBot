EloBot is a useless bot created because I was bored, it display the elo of the players of league of legends by recovering the data of the website [OP.GG](http://euw.op.gg/).

You can add EloBot to your Discord Server on  [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=405529878138585088&permissions=0&scope=bot).
